# TagPackGenerators

In investigating Cryptocurrencies and Virtual Assets, **attribution is key**.
A TagPack contains information about the actors owning the asset and where this information was found.

This repository contains codes to convert public information regarding tagged virtual assets to the [GraphSense TagPacks format](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-tagpacks).

Please refer to the READMEs in each folder to use the converters. 

## Prerequisit - for all of the converters in the sub-folders

Works with Python3.  
Requires Python tools: *regex* (re), *PyYAML* (yaml), and *requests* (requests).  
Python tools *datetime* and *json* should already be installed.  

These are typically installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)  
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
