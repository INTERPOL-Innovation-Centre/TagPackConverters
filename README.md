# TagPackGenerators

In investigating Cryptocurrencies and Virtual Assets, **attribution is key**.
A TagPack contains information about the actors owning the asset and where this information was found.

This repository contains codes to convert public information regarding tagged virtual assets to the [GraphSense TagPacks format](https://github.com/graphsense/graphsense-tagpacks).

Please refer to the READMEs in each folder to use the converters. 

*This repository only contains the code, not the police data. Please do not store your TagPack(s) in this repository.*
