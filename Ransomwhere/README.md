# WORK IN PROGRESS
While the web interface provides information sources, the downloadable data does not provide them at the moment. We are asking the developer to show such information as well.


# Ransomwhere

This codes convert the data publicised at [Ransomwhere](https://ransomwhe.re/) to GraphSense TagPacks. Ransomwhere is the open, crowdsourced ransomware payment tracker. Browse and download ransomware payment data or help build our dataset by reporting ransomware demands you have received. 

# Usage
```
python3 generateTagPack.py
```

You may find the output named `ransomwhere_tagpack.yaml`.
